## Open Restaurants NYC

Outdoor Dining NYC brings together all the data from the cities outdoor restaurant program to display to users a concise map with all available outdoor dining options. This project allows users find and see options in their zipcode, compare zipcodes, and even filter by type of outdoor dining.


Data Sources:

This data comes from Open Data NYC (good source). I chose to use this source because it provides a substantial amount of data regarding open dining options. In fact, it may have all the open dining info for the city. This allows me to have accurate visualizations for the user, and not miss any crucial info. 
I used all the data from the aforementioned data source,  but one of the first things I did was reduce the number of columns, by deleting useless/ irrelevant/ duplicate info.
One of the first things I did to process the file was combing duplicate restaurant info (Just like assignment 36), since many restaurants have chain or franchised locations.
I donâ€™t believe that I will have many problems cleaning our extracting data from the source. At the same time, there may be nuances within the data that may affect the visualization portion of the project. I foresee issues with folium markers and possibly the map in general.
